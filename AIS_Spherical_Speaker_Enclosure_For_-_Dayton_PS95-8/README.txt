# Summary

IMPORTANT!!! - If you do end up printing this, be sure to print the baffle (the part the speaker mounts to) with a relatively high infill percent, if not entirely solid. Or you could have at least 6-7 exterior walls. When you go to mount the driver with screws, you will want something for the screws to dig into. I had to use T nuts to mount my drivers, and using T nuts in the thin plastic can be kind of sketchy. Just a heads up :)

This is a spherical ported speaker enclosure that I designed for the Dayton PS95-8 3.5" full range driver. (Link here: http://www.parts-express.com/dayton-audio-ps95-8-3-1-2-point-source-full-range-driver-8-ohm--295-349)

I first started this as an experiment but I eventually developed this design for them. The enclosures are .11 cu ft tuned to 74hz. I included the STL for the sphere portion and port portion, however if your printer is large enough I also included the full model. The stand is in there as well. If anyone does decide to make this, I'd be happy to hear from you. Knowing someone made something from my design would be very rewarding for me.

Note: the stand and full model aren't oriented correctly. The stand should just be printed flat, and the full model should probably be printed baffle down (I haven't printed it so I can't say, but you can probably be the judge of this).

Here is an album showing progress pictures, assembly and the finished product.

Tips are welcome but don't ever feel obligated to do so! :)

Thanks for looking!
